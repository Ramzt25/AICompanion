### Quick Start Commands:
```bash
# Start infrastructure
docker compose -f infra/docker-compose.yml up -d

# Start development server  
cd apps/web && npm run dev

# Test the API
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "What is machine learning?"}'
```
